# Exploring the Role of Language in Public Perception of Environmental Health and Exposure Risks Using EEG

Understanding public perception of environmental health and exposure risks is critical for developing effective public health strategies. Traditional methods, such as surveys and retrospective analyses, often fail to capture real-time cognitive and emotional responses, limiting their effectiveness due to biases in linguistic framing and the absence of neural data integration.

This repository introduces the **Cognitive-Linguistic Integration Framework (CLIF)**, a novel approach that combines linguistic embeddings and cognitive state modeling using **EEG data**. CLIF explores how language influences public perception and decision-making, providing actionable insights for risk communication and policy development.

## Features

### Cognitive-Linguistic Integration Framework (CLIF)
- **Advanced Linguistic Embeddings:** Decodes the influence of linguistic framing on perception using state-of-the-art language models.
- **Cognitive State Modeling:** Utilizes EEG data to analyze neural responses and emotional reactions to language stimuli.
- **Hierarchical Reasoning:** Integrates external knowledge bases and dynamic adaptation strategies for enhanced cognitive modeling.
- **Real-Time Feedback Mechanisms:** Iteratively refines cognitive state predictions based on continuous feedback.

### Key Benefits
- **Real-Time Neural Analysis:** Captures immediate cognitive and emotional responses to linguistic framing.
- **Semantic Alignment:** Improves accuracy in understanding the impact of language on perception and decision-making.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides guidance for optimizing public health communication strategies and evidence-based policy formulation.

## Experiments and Results
- **Perception Analysis:** Demonstrated the nuanced impacts of linguistic framing on cognitive states using EEG data.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved superior semantic alignment, adaptability, and accuracy compared to traditional approaches.
- **Public Engagement Insights:** Revealed actionable insights for enhancing public health communication and engagement strategies.
